# Front End Certification Project #4 â€“ *freeCodeCamp*

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my 4th project for the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

## Notes

Hit a bit of a burnout wall during this one, so:

- The styling is a bit rough.
- JavaScript isn't as clean or optimized as it could be.

regardless, thanks for stopping by!
